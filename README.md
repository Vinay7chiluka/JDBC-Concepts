# JDBC-Concepts
JDBC, which stands for Java Database Connectivity, is an API (Application Programming Interface) that allows Java programs to interact with relational databases. It provides a set of classes and interfaces that enable developers to write Java code to perform various database operations such as connecting to a database, executing SQL statements, and retrieving results.

Here are some key points about JDBC:
------------------------------------
1. JDBC, which stands for Java Database Connectivity, is an API (Application Programming Interface) that allows Java programs to interact with relational databases. It provides a set of classes and interfaces that enable developers to write Java code to perform various database operations such as connecting to a database, executing SQL statements, and retrieving results.
2. JDBC Drivers: JDBC drivers are software components that implement the JDBC API and provide the necessary functionality to connect to a specific database.
3. JDBC API: The JDBC API consists of a set of interfaces and classes that define the methods and operations for interacting with a database. Some of the key interfaces in the JDBC API include Connection, Statement, PreparedStatement, CallableStatement, ResultSet, and ResultSetMetaData. These interfaces provide methods for executing SQL queries, updating the database, and retrieving results.
4. SQL Operations: JDBC allows you to execute SQL statements such as SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, and DELETE. You can use Statement objects to execute static SQL statements, PreparedStatement objects for precompiled SQL statements with parameters, and CallableStatement objects to execute stored procedures.
